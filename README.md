# 💰 Loan Data Analysis using NumPy

This project showcases data preprocessing and analytical techniques applied to a real-world loan dataset of over **1,000 records**, containing a mix of **numerical** and **categorical** data types. The goal is to prepare clean, structured data for downstream machine learning or statistical analysis using only **NumPy**.

---

## 📊 Overview

- **Analyzed and preprocessed** a real-world loan dataset with over 1,000 records using only **NumPy** for numerical computations.
- **Handled missing values** by computing and imputing **mean statistics**, ensuring clean and usable data for analysis.
- **Separated and transformed** mixed data types by identifying **string vs. numeric columns** using advanced NumPy operations like `argwhere`, `isnan`, and **conditional slicing**.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy** – Array manipulation, missing data handling, and custom logic
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For writing and running analysis
